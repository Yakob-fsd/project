                <p>A treasure trove of natural wonders and historical edifices, Kollam is an enchanting town with backwaters and picturesque landscapes. Located 70kms away from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Kollam is a commercial centre and home to India’s cashew producing industry. Popularly known as Quilon, it is often regarded as the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala.<br> 
                    <br>It sits on the bank of the Ashtamudi Lake, hence, cruising along the Alappuzha route is one of the main highlights of the region.
