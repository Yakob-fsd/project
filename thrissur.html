Thrissur later became anglicised to Trichur. <br>
                  <br>Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter. Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is incomplete without witnessing these.
